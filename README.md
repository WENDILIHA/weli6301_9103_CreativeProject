In the group's section, the circles are both independent and interconnected. In order to enrich the work, I think that it is especially important to give each circle the effect of expansion and connection. First of all, the initial inspiration for my work came from the example shown by my LECTURE teacher in week 12. I utilized the timer function to adjust the rotation angle of the particles around the circle clockwise based on the accumulation of time. Also, this rotation angle only affects the top curve or line when the mouse is slid across the canvas. In addition, I added a click event: when the mouse clicks on a circle, the code will re-render the shape of the circle.
